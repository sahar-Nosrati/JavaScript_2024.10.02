- k6 -> an open-source, developer-friendly, and extensible load testing tool. It helps to prevent performance issues and proactively improve reliability.

- k6 -> evaluation of the reliability and performance of your application and infrastructure
- k6 -> helps engineering teams prevent errors and SLO breaches, enabling them to build resilient and high-performing applications that scale.

- usage k6 for ->
  - Load and performance testing -> 
    - optimization for minimal resource consumption and designed for running high-load performance tests such as spike, stress, or soak tests.
  - Browser performance testing ->  by  k6 browser API -> performing of browser based performance testing -> collection of browser    metrics  -> identifying performance issues related to browsers
  - Performance and synthetic monitoring 
  - Automation of performance tests -> 
    - integrates seamlessly with CI/CD and automation tools
  - Chaos and resilience testing -> 
    - simulation of the traffic as part of your chaos experiments


- Spike test -> evaluation system functionality and its performance under  -> experience events of sudden and massive traffic.

- Spike testing increases to extremely high loads in a very short or non-existent ramp-up time. Usually, it has no plateau period or is very brief. In the same way, the ramp-down is very fast or non-existent, letting the process iterate only once.

- Spike test -> when the system expects to receive a sudden rush of activity 
- spike test consideration ->
  - Focus on key processes
  - The test often wonâ€™t finish.
  - Run, tune, repeat.
  - Monitor

- Stress testing ->  Evaluation of how the system performs when loads are heavier than usual.
- The load pattern of a stress test resembles that of an average-load test. -> differences ->
  -  higher load ->
    - longer ramp-up period 

- stress test ->  verification of the stability and reliability of the system under conditions of heavy use
- stress test ->  evaluation of the CPU, memory, network, or overall performance.
